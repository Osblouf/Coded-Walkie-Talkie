Object : Concerns the tests and debugs on socket point to point communication

Topic :
	Problems inerant on connexion from client to server.
	Reported errors (networks error are not included here) :
		- main problem between doubled transmission is the problem of synchronization.
		- in fact, when switching from source to destination we need feedback to avoid 
		collisions...
		- blocking line waiting for enter key to be released.

Note : client to server system seems to be working at aalborg's sporthojskole

TO DO :
	-> Talk about communication protocol involving several nodes,
		Suggestion : node wants to emit : if read data is empty => writes
			/!\ If another node is emitting at the same moment ?
